# Clean Code Guardrails

This document enforces implementation discipline. Architecture ownership lives in `architecture.instructions.md`.

## Dead Code

- Remove dead code incrementally in small, safe commits — never suppress or ignore lint/type errors.
- Do not add new exports "for later" — add them when they are consumed.

## Styling Boundary

- Raw class definitions and styling decisions live in `ui/components/` (the ui layer).
- Prefab components compose UI primitives and follow the layering model from `architecture.instructions.md`.
- CSS custom properties (variables) for runtime-dynamic values (colors, animations); avoid React state for frequently-updated visuals.

## Refactoring Discipline

- Prefer **migration-first** fixes: update the code, then remove the old path. Never suppress type errors or lint rules as a shortcut.
- Keep refactors **incremental and reviewable**: one concern per commit. Avoid broad renames mixed with logic changes.
- Preserve existing UX behaviour while restructuring. Refactors must not change observable behaviour unless that is the stated goal.

## Suppression Rules

- `// eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error` require a comment explaining why.
- Never use `any` as a type unless bridging an untyped third-party boundary — document the reason.
- Do not use `!` (non-null assertion) when a null check is feasible.

## General

- Logic that is used once does not need a helper or abstraction.
- Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not change.
- Run `npm run format` before commit when touching multiple files.
